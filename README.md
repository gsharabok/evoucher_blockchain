# E-Voucher Blockchain Solution
Issuing vouchers is an alternative means to implement social welfare. While
paper-based voucher is a working method, it is susceptible to some security issues such as
counterfeiting, reproducing, and their relatively low effectiveness. This project explores how
to implement necessary security methods with encryption and cryptography in form of a
consortium blockchain to build a secure e-voucher system as an alternative for its traditional
paper-based voucher.

## Research
The architecture of the solution comes from the following paper: <br />
